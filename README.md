# Python POO and graphics experiments (hiatus)
 I'm leaning object oriented programing and graphics in python, trying to implement some visualizations (Most based on coding train's videos), using some nice modules, like Pygame, and Corey Schaffer POO tutorials
 
 I'll take the CS50 course, so I'll focus on that for now, but I'll comeback to this eventually, because is really fun to work with visualizations, and I'm still trying to figure out a way to inplement Class Methods and Static Methods on the Mandelbrot set. Eventually I want to have a visualization for every video on Corey Schaffer's POO playlist.
